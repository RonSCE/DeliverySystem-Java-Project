# DeliverySystem-Java-Project
## An exercise in Java design patterns, GUI and multi-threading

## General Information
This project is a simulation of a mail delivery system. In it is a UI made using Java's Swing UI elements, as well as different components for a mail delivery system such as
customers, transport trucks and branches all created using various Java design patterns (Observer, DCL Singlton, Threadpools etc) that all run simultaniously using Multi-threading.

## Technologies:
* Java 7 or above.

## Launch: 
Run the file Game.java in the 'program' folder, use the 'Create system' button to initialize the components and click 'Start' to let the system begin simulation.
Use the various UI elements to browse the different options available to you. 

## Project status: 
No longer being worked on. This was an exercise in getting familiar with Java's design patterns and multithreading, as well as the UI elements available without the need of 3rd
party software. As such, I plan on taking my conclusions and applying them to bigger and better projects later on.
